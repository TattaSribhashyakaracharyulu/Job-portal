# Job Portal

This is a simple **MERN Stack Job Portal** project I built in Dec 2024.  
The idea is to create a platform where **job seekers** can find opportunities and apply with their resumes, while **employers** can post jobs and track applications easily.  

I wanted to make the hiring process smoother with features like:  
- Resume uploads  
- Job search & matching  
- Application status updates in real-time  
- Separate dashboards for job seekers and employers  

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Auth:** JWT  

### How to run it
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install` in both `client` and `server`  
3. Setup `.env` for backend (Mongo URI + JWT Secret)  
4. Run backend → `npm start`  
5. Run frontend → `npm start`
